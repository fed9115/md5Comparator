# md5Comparator
At the engineering sites, NR Electric often needs to compare the new and old software versions of which program items are updated or added. However, since each version of the software usually has a size of nearly 20G, it is unrealistic to manually compare the programs in each directory and identify whether they are updated, added or deleted. Therefore, comparing them with the MD5 code unique to each file is a good solution. While comparing program projects, we also need to package the different items into a tar.gz archive. Therefore, this program implements the packaging of the specific items corresponding to the paths while generating the txt format containing the absolute paths description of the addition and deletion items. It also provides a GUI window, allowing customers to choose new and old version folders and the save path.
